The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is an intergovernmental organisation comprised of 38 countries which describe themselves as committed to democracy and the market economy. It was originally created as the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC) in 1948 as part of the Marshall Plan following World War 2, and originally was comprised only of Western European states. In 1961 it was reformed into the OECD and membership was opened to non-European states, the first of which were the United States and Canada. The OECD publishes a variety of economic data, and ranks member countries across economic and social indicators.
